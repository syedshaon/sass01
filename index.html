                <h2>X-rays</h2>
                <img class="triangle" src="photos/xray.png" alt="" />
                <p>X-rays are a vital and necessary part of dental diagnostic process. Without them, certain dental
                    conditions can and will be missed. X-rays detect much more than cavities. With an x-ray the dentist
                    can
                    survey erupting teeth, diagnose bone diseases, evaluate the results of an injury, or plan
                    orthodontic
                    treatment. If dental problems are found and treated early, dental care is more comfortable and
                    affordable.
                    We are particularly careful to minimize the exposure of their patients to radiation. With
                    contemporary
                    safeguards, the amount of radiation received in a dental x-ray examination is extremely small. The
                    risk
                    is negligible. In fact, the dental radiographs represent a far smaller risk than an undetected and
                    untreated dental problem. Lead body aprons and shields are used as a protection. We use digital
                    equipment which filters out unnecessary x-rays and restricts the x-ray to the area of interest.</p>

                <p>Sports guards are not something we always think about when you or your child are out on the field.
                    An
                    athlete is 60 times more likely to suffer harm to the teeth. When choosing a sports guard, find one
                    that fits properly and comfortable, is resilient and tear resistant, easy to clean and doesn’t
                    restrict
                    speech or breathing. For more questions be sure to ask us at your next visit or call and make an

                <h2>Fluoride</h2>
                <img class="triangle" src="photos/floride.png" alt="" />
                <p>Fluoride is a mineral that occurs naturally in all water sources, including the oceans. Research has
                    shown that fluoride not only prevents cavities in children and adults, it also helps repair the
                    early
                    stages of tooth decay even before the decay is visible. During childhood, when teeth are still
                    forming,
                    fluoride works by making tooth enamel more resistant to the acid that causes tooth decay. For
                    adolescents and adults, the benefits are just as great. Fluoride helps repair or re-mineralize
                    areas
                    where the acid attacks have already begun. For older adults, fluoride has been effective in
                    reducing
                    tooth decay along the gum line (often called "root" caries).</p>

                <h2>Pregnancy?</h2>
                <img class="triangle" src="photos/baby.png" alt="" />
                <p>During Pregnancy, your hormone levels rise considerably. Gingivitis is especially common during the
                    second through the eighth months of pregnancy. Gingivitis may cause red, puffy, or tender gums that
                    tend to bleed easily. If serious enough it could lead to periodontal disease. It is important to
                    brush
                    thoroughly twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste and floss. Keeping a healthy diet while pregnant
                    will
                    help prevent tooth decay and keeps you and your baby healthy.</p>
